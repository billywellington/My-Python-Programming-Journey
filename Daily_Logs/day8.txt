Monday marked the beginning of my second week since I resumed my Python learning journey.

Days 5, 6, and 7 were unproductive for me as I was occupied throughout the entire weekend.

Today, I decided to create a rock-paper-scissors game. It took me almost 1.5 hours, and I was satisfied with the result. I added a twist by introducing scores: 2 points for each win, 1 point for a tie, and none for a loss. I offered it to friends to try, but they felt the "bot" (the computer) cheated them since they couldn't physically engage with it. Nonetheless, I was pleased with the progress I made.

At the start, I wasn't confident that I could complete this task on my own. I even considered looking up the code or asking ChatGPT for some guidance. However, I'm glad I pushed through and am making progress.

Next, I plan to create a quiz game that will store questions, answers, and scores.
