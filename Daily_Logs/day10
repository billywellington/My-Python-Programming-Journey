Today started slowly, but I realized that I've been falling behind since I started with object-oriented programming. I noticed that if I don't understand something or didn't grasp a certain topic well, it becomes difficult to master subsequent concepts. So, today, I made a conscious decision to seek more understanding on OOP through other resources, and it worked. I'm taking it one step at a time, and I'm glad it's starting to stick.
