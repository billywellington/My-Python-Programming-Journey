This is day 4 of my Python learning journey, and the idea to start a journal only occurred to me today, not at the beginning.

For my programming journey, I'm relying on free online resources, and one gem I've discovered is the YouTube channel "Bro Code." The guy running it is fantastic. Although it's just a basic introduction, I believe it's sufficient to lay a crucial foundation for me. Therefore, I've decided to stick with it. I've started with his Python full course, which spans 12 hours.

I don't just passively watch the videos; I always ensure that my PC is with me so I can follow along as he teaches and explains concepts. I find this hands-on approach beneficial.

Here's a breakdown of my progress through the video course:

-   Day 1 (yesterday): I watched up to 25 minutes.
-   Day 2:  2:16:55
