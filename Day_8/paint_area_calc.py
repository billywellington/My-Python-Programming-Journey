# You are painting a wall. The instructions on the paint can says that 
# 1 can of paint can cover 5 square meters of wall. Given a random height and width of wall, 
# calculate how many cans of paint you'll need to buy.

# number of cans = (wall height x wall width) รท coverage per can.

# e.g. Height = 2, Width = 4, Coverage = 5

# number of cans = (2 * 4) / 5
#                = 1.6
# But because you can't buy 0.6 of a can of paint, 
# the result should be rounded up to 2 cans.
